# opencode-starter

> A launcher toolkit for AI coding tools powered by [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) backends.

opencode-starter is an interactive CLI wizard that configures and launches AI coding tools — starting with Claude Code — using OpenCode Zen, Go, or your own local providers (Groq, Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and more). Built to be extensible: future tools (Codex, Aider, and others) will be added over time.

## Features

- **Backend selector** — choose OpenCode Zen (free tier + subscription) or OpenCode Go (subscription)
- **Subscription-aware** — tells the wizard what you have access to (free / Zen / Go / both), filters models accordingly
- **Free models highlighted** — green `(free)` label makes it easy to spot zero-cost options
- **Built-in SDK adapter proxy** — non-Anthropic local providers route through the Vercel AI SDK (same packages OpenCode uses) so Claude Code talks to them in Anthropic format; labeled `(via proxy)` in the list
- **Clean environment isolation** — removes conflicting env vars (Vertex AI, Bedrock, AWS, Foundry) in the child process only; opencode-starter never writes `~/.claude/settings.json` (see caveat below)
- **Secure key storage** — stores your API key in the OS credential store (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) or your shell profile — your choice
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Windows, and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, and other distros with GNOME Keyring or KWallet)
- **Dry run mode** — preview exactly what would be run without launching anything
- **Preference memory** — remembers your last backend, provider, and model, pre-selects them next time
- **Local providers** — use any model from your [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) config (BYOK) alongside Zen/Go cloud backends; new providers added in OpenCode appear automatically (Cerebras, Perplexity, Bedrock, etc.)
- **Favorite models** — save up to 20 favorites and switch between them mid-session via Claude Code's `/model` command
- **Smart model pickers** — recent models per provider, search for large lists (>25), or paginated browse (15 per page)

## Supported tools

| Tool | Command | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Claude Code | `opencode-starter claude` | ✅ Supported |
| Favorite models | `opencode-starter models` | ✅ Supported |
| API server | `opencode-starter server` | ✅ Supported |
| Codex | `opencode-starter codex` | 🔜 Planned |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- One of the supported AI coding tools installed (e.g. [Claude Code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code))
- An [OpenCode API key](https://opencode.ai/auth) for Zen/Go cloud backends
- [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed and configured for local providers (optional — only needed for BYOK providers: Groq, Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Cerebras, Perplexity, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g opencode-starter

# Upgrade to the latest version
npm update -g opencode-starter
```

## Setup

Get your API key at [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).

On first run, `opencode-starter` will prompt you for the key and ask where to save it. Options vary by OS:

| Platform | Secure storage | Plaintext fallback |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| macOS | Keychain (optional: + `~/.zshrc` auto-load) | Shell profile |
| Windows | Credential Manager | `setx` user env var |
| Linux (desktop) | Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet) | Shell profile |
| Linux (headless) | — | Shell profile |

The key is always active immediately in the current session regardless of which option you choose. No need to restart your terminal.

## Usage

```bash
opencode-starter claude
```

On first run, the wizard asks about your OpenCode subscription so it can show the right models. This is saved and skipped on subsequent runs. If local providers are configured in OpenCode, you'll also be asked which provider to use (cloud Zen/Go or a local one).

Bare `opencode-starter` now prints help and migration guidance. It no longer launches Claude Code. Use `opencode-starter claude` for the Claude Code wizard and launcher.

### Favorite models and mid-session switching

Save models you switch between often:

```bash
opencode-starter models
```

Add up to 20 favorites from Zen, Go, or any local provider. When you have favorites, `opencode-starter claude` automatically starts a multi-route proxy. Claude Code's `/model` command then lists your starting model plus favorites — switch live without restarting.

With no favorites, launch behaves exactly as before (single model, no switch menu). `--dry-run` ignores saved favorites so you can preview a single-model launch.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Run the full wizard but preview the launch command instead of executing |
| `--setup` | Re-configure your subscription tier |
| `--trace` | Write Claude Code debug logs to `/tmp/opencode-starter-debug.log` and show errors on exit |
| `--help` | Show usage |
| `--version` | Show version |

Starter flags go after the `claude` command:

```bash
opencode-starter claude --dry-run
opencode-starter claude --setup
opencode-starter claude --trace
```

Claude Code flags and session IDs pass through unchanged:

```bash
opencode-starter claude -c
opencode-starter claude --resume abc-123
opencode-starter claude abc-123
```

Use `--` when you want every following token passed directly to Claude Code:

```bash
opencode-starter claude -- --print "hello"
opencode-starter claude -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
opencode-starter claude --dry-run -- --print "test"
```

## Server mode

Run OpenCode Starter as a foreground API gateway:

```bash
opencode-starter server
```

The server asks whether to listen locally or on the network.

Local mode binds to `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="anything"
```

Network mode binds to `0.0.0.0` and asks for a server password:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://<server-ip>:17645/anthropic"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<server-password>"
```

By default, the server password is kept in memory only. If you choose to save it, OpenCode Starter stores it in `~/.opencode-starter/config.json`.

The server loads Zen/Go models plus any configured local providers (same discovery as `claude`). Spinner output shows how many models came from local providers.

The server also exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints for OpenAI-format models:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:17645/openai/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="anything"
```

## How it works

### Subscription tiers

On first run, opencode-starter asks what you have access to:

| Tier | Backends available | Models shown |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| Free only | Zen | Free Zen models only |
| Zen subscription | Zen | All Zen models (paid + free) |
| Go subscription | Zen + Go | All Go models + Zen free models |
| Both | Zen + Go | All models on both backends |

Run `opencode-starter claude --setup` at any time to change your tier.

### Environment isolation

When launched, opencode-starter builds a clean child environment:

1. Removes 17 conflicting env vars from the child process (Vertex AI, Bedrock, AWS, Foundry, stale Anthropic config)
2. Sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` for the session
3. Passes `--model <selected>` to the tool as a belt-and-suspenders override

When the tool exits — for any reason (normal exit, Ctrl+C, terminal close) — your shell environment is unchanged. **No cleanup step, no restore needed.**

**Caveat — Claude Code persists the model:** opencode-starter does not edit `~/.claude/settings.json`, but Claude Code itself saves the model you launched with (via `--model` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`). A later bare `claude` launch may still show that model — e.g. `anthropic-opencode-go__deepseek-v4-flash` from a prior opencode-starter session. To return to a first-party default, run `claude --model sonnet` (or your preferred Claude model), or remove the `"model"` key from `~/.claude/settings.json`. If you used the favorites switch menu, Claude Code may also cache the gateway catalog at `~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json`; delete that file if `/model` shows stale entries from a dead local proxy.

### Model compatibility

OpenCode exposes models through different API formats. opencode-starter handles them transparently when possible:

| Model format | Examples | How it works | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic native | Claude, Qwen, MiniMax (Go) | Direct connection | *(none)* |
| OpenAI chat completions | DeepSeek, Kimi, MiMo, GLM, Grok, GPT-4o (local OpenAI) | Local SDK adapter proxy (Vercel AI SDK) | `via proxy` |
| OpenAI Responses API | GPT-5.4+, GPT-5.5, Codex, o-series (local OpenAI only) | Same proxy; SDK auto-selects Responses API | `via proxy` |
| Gemini native | Gemini (local Google provider) | SDK adapter uses Gemini native API | `via proxy` |
| Other SDK providers | Cerebras, Perplexity, Bedrock, Vertex, Together AI, etc. | Whatever `api.npm` OpenCode assigns — dynamic SDK import | `via proxy` |
| Not in cloud wizard | GPT, Gemini on OpenCode Zen/Go | Use local provider instead (OpenAI/Google in OpenCode config) | `not yet supported` |

The SDK adapter proxy starts automatically on a random local port for proxy-routed models and stops when Claude Code exits. Each `opencode-starter claude` session gets its own port — multiple terminals are safe. (`opencode-starter server` uses a fixed port `17645`; only one server instance per machine.)

### Provider notes

**Mistral (free tier):** API rate limits are tight. Expect HTTP 429 during tool-heavy sessions; Claude Code will retry with backoff. This is Mistral-side throttling, not a proxy bug.

**OpenAI (local provider):** Configure OpenAI in [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) with your API key, then pick the OpenAI provider at launch. Newer GPT models use OpenAI's Responses API — the SDK selects `responses` vs `chat` from the model ID. OpenCode catalog IDs may differ from API IDs (e.g. `gpt-5.5-fast` maps to upstream `gpt-5.5`). If you see "model not available", check `/tmp/opencode-proxy-debug.log` for the `route=` and `sdk:` lines.

`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS=1` is set for direct (non-proxy) routes only. Local proxy sessions preserve tool-search betas.

### API key storage

opencode-starter uses [`@napi-rs/keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/keyring) to interface with the OS credential store. On subsequent runs it checks the credential store silently — if a key is found, the wizard skips the key prompt entirely.

| Platform | Credential store | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| macOS | macOS Keychain | Optional `~/.zshrc` auto-load line makes the key available system-wide |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager | `setx` available as a plaintext alternative |
| Linux (desktop) | Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) | Requires a running keyring daemon |
| Linux (headless) | Not available | Falls back to shell profile or session-only |

If the native module fails to load on an unsupported platform, the credential store options are silently skipped and only shell profile / session-only storage is offered.

### Preference persistence

Your last backend, provider, model selection, recent models per provider, favorite models, subscription tier, model cache, and optional saved server password are saved to:

```text
~/.opencode-starter/config.json
```

The OpenCode API key is handled separately by the key storage option you choose during setup.
